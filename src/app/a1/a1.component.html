    <h1>A1: Widget Factory in Adobe Spectrum</h1>
        <p>In this assignment, you are working for My Widget Factory, a new disruptor in the widget-making industry. They have recently designed their line of custom widgets, and want your help getting their online store to market!</p>
        <p>Luckily for you, My Widget Factory's lead developer spent a bit of time making a basic store. The store allows a person to select, customize, and order widgets. But unfortunately, it looks like it was designed in the late-90's, and they are worried that this will impact sales. So, they want <strong>you</strong> to modernize the look and feel with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_system">Design System</a>.</p>
        <p>This assignment has three parts, with a part due each week. In the first week (<a href="assignments/a1#mockup">Part 1</a>), you will first mock up a design for your online store. You will then implement your design using Spectrum's Web Components, with a check-in midway (<a href="assignments/a1#checkin">Part 2</a>) and a final implementation (<a href="assignments/a1#final">Part 3</a>). This assignment is worth <strong>25 points</strong>, distributed among the three parts.</p>
        <h2>A Tour of the Factory</h2>
        <p>There are three pages that you will need to support: an order page, a shipping page, and a summary page. The images below show examples from the functional implemetation using plain HTML and a tiny bit of CSS, provided to you in the <code>default_html</code> folder.</p>
        <h3>Order Page</h3>
        <p>The factory supports the sale of four types of widgets: a Toy Boat, a Paper Plane, a Stuffed Animal, and a Train Car. To keep shipping costs down, the company wants to limit online orders to a max of 10 of each widget. The factory is particularly excited that all widgets are made-to-order. This means that each widget can be personalized to be whatever color of the customer decides!</p>
        <p>After years of in-person sales, the company has set a price point for each widget where they can still turn a profit, and gathered an average "star rating" out of five from their customers. The Train Cars are particularly expensive to produce, and not very well-liked by customers... maybe they will phase them out soon.</p>
        <img width="250px" class="image" src="assignments/a1_toyboat.png" alt="The Toy Boat widget. This widget sells for $15.99 and has a 4.6 rating. The user has used the input fields to specify that they want to order 10 yellow widgets.">
        <h3>Shipping Page</h3>
        <p>For the moment, the company is only able to ship widgets within the U.S., which simplifies the order fields. They support three shipping speeds: "express", "standard", and "slow", which each have different price points. Once shipping is specified, the customer can place an order!</p>
        <img width="500px" class="image" src="assignments/a1_shipping.png" alt="The user has used the input fields to specify that they want to ship to 6093 Donald Bren Hall in Irvine, CA 92617. They have selected Standard 5-Day Shipping, which costs $3.99">
        <h3>Summary Page</h3>
        <p>Finally, each order gets returned with an invoice summarizing what was purchased. The company is somewhat flexible with what shows up in the invoice. They know that customers want to see the total price, shipping destination, and arrival date. But other information is optional or can be reformatted.</p>
        <img width="400px" class="image" src="assignments/a1_summary.png" alt="The Order Summary page. The user is purchasing 19 widgets in total, costing nearly $250. Their widgets will arrive on March 5th.">
        <p>Overall, My Widget Factory is open to improvements to the design of their store. Take their current website as an example, but feel free to be creative or think more critically about the potential needs of their customers.</p>
        <h2>Starter Code</h2>
        <p>The code is available for download <a href="https://github.com/uci-inf-285/a1-widget-factory">on GitHub</a>. <span class="tbd">I'm still deciding whether it's worth it to implement GitHub classroom, require use of repositories, etc. It's a lot of overhead to introduce to students, but maaaaaaybe worth the effort?</span></p>
        <h3>Repository Structure</h3>
        <p>We have provided eight files (and one folder) to you. You will edit some of them in this assignment, but not all.</p>
        <p>The files you <em>should not</em> need to edit are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>.gitignore</code>, which specifies what files should not be a part of version control.</li>
            <li><code>favicon.ico</code>, which specifies the icon to render in your browser bar to represent the online store. You can choose to change this if you like, such as to make consistent theming in your design. But doing so is not required.</li>
            <li><code>shipping_data.js</code> and <code>widgets_data.js</code>. These two files include data about the respective prices and ratings for the widgets, and shipping costs and duration. This data is referenced in <code>script.js</code>, but you may also find it useful to look at.</li>
            <li><code>script.js</code>. This file includes all of the coding logic for storing information about desired widgets and shipping costs between pages, and calculating the total cost for the summary page.</li>
            <li>You may additionally find it useful to refer to the <code>default_html</code> folder, which provides a functional implementation of the store.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that this means you <strong>should not edit any JavaScript files</strong>. You may choose to, but only for adding functionality beyond the assignment requirements.</p>
        <p>The files you <em>should</em> edit are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>index.html</code>: The HTML file for the order page for your store, where a customer selects what widgets to order and of what color.</li>
            <li><code>shipping.html</code>: The HTML file for the shipping page, where a customer selects where to send the widgets and what speed of shipping.</li>
            <li><code>summary.html</code>: The HTML file for the order summary page, where a customer can see their order summarized.</li>
            <li><code>style.css</code>: The CSS file to style all three pages on your site. It is possible to complete the assignment without editing this file. But you may find it useful for using custom CSS in your design.</li>
            <li><code>readme.docx</code>: A document with some questions to fill out about your experience using a Design System.</li>
            <li>You will also need to add a file (either <code>mockup.fig</code> or <code>mockup.xd</code>) for your design mockup. See <a href="assignments/a1#mockup">Part 1</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Editing and Running your Code</h3>
        <p>We recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). But you can use whatever program you want to edit your code. To run your site, you can open it up in your favorite browser.</p>
        <p>On the order page and the shipping page, the coding logic (<code>script.js</code>) is expecting specific HTML <code>id</code>s to be used to indicate input fields. On the order page (<code>index.html</code>), these inputs are of the form <code>*_quantity</code> and <code>*_color</code>, where <code>*</code> refers to each of the four types of widgets (<code>toyboat</code>, <code>paperplane</code>, <code>stuffedanimal</code>, and <code>traincar</code>). The shipping page (<code>shipping.html</code>) expects <code>id</code>s for the <code>address</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>state</code>, and <code>zip</code>, as well as the <code>shipping_speed</code>. You might notice that the company's servers take a bit of time (about two seconds) to process shipping information and prepare the order. If you have an HTML element that you want to show up while waiting, you can give it the <code>id</code> of <code>loading_progress</code>, plus the <code>hidden</code> attribute.</p>
        <p>On the summary page (<code>summary.html</code>), the coding logic (<code>script.js</code>) uses specific HTML <code>id</code>s to then re-populate information the customer entered about their order and summarize it. The page uses the same <code>id</code>s for <code>*_quantity</code> and <code>*_color</code> to refer to the amount and color of each widget ordered. If you want to summarize the total cost of shipping a type of widget, the coding logic also populates <code>id</code>s for <code>*_subtotal</code>. The coding logic similarly uses the same <code>id</code>s for <code>address</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>zip</code>, and <code>shipping_speed</code>, plus a <code>shipping_subtotal</code> to summarize the cost of shipping. Finally, the <code>id</code> of <code>arrival_date</code> is used to indicate when the package will arrive.</p>
        <p>We expect that it will be useful to refer to the <code>default_html</code> folder to understand how these different <code>id</code>s are used in practice.</p>

        <h3>Due {{assignments[0].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>For the first part of the assignment, mock up a design for the online store. You must make your mockup following an existing Design System, as you will later use components of that system in your implementation.</p>
        <p>After consulting with the IN4MATX 285 course staff, My Widget Factory has specifically asked you to use <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/">Adobe's Spectrum</a>, a powerful Design System that has an implementation of <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/">Web Components</a>. There is a widely-used UI Kit for Spectrum on <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1211274196563394418">Figma</a>. Spectrum also maintains a <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/spectrum-xd-plugin/">Plugin</a> for <a href="https://adobexdplatform.com/">Adobe XD</a>. You are welcome to use either, though Figma is recommended since Adobe is stopping support for XD.</p>
        <p>We will focus on <strong>Spectrum Components</strong> in this course. Adobe's Design Sytem has a wide range of different suggestions for how to implement an interface, from recommendations around <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/voice-and-tone/">voice and tone</a> to <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/in-product-word-list/">words</a> to include or exclude in your product. These are all excellent resources to look over, and offer useful advice on interaction design principles. We will primarily focus on the implementation aspects of the system in this assignment.</p>
        <p>You can design your store however you wish, within a few constraints. You must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support all functionality demonstrated in the basic web store provided to you</strong>. This includes the sale of the four widgets, and displaying price and rating information. A customer can select how many to purchase (up to 10 of each). You must support entering shipping information, and summary page with the total cost and arrival date. It's up to you whether to include subtotals, unit prices, etc. in the summary.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement your store as three separate pages</strong>, one for the order, one for the shipping information, and one for a summary. The lead developer has implemented the backend of web store assuming this separation.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement the store to be functional on large screens</strong> (e.g., traditional Desktop browsers). Although My Widget Factory feels that it would be ideal for their store to look good on a mobile browser, they recognize that you are limited in your time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exactly <em>how</em> you go about supporting these functionalities is up to you. Spectrum has a long list of components in their Design System which can assist in creating your design. Overall design principles (e.g., interaction design) are beyond the scope of this class, but hopefully your prior courses have offered some guidance on how to approach this task.</p>
        <p>You may choose to customize any of the visual components of the store. For example, we have provided images licensed under Creative Commons (with attribution) as examples of the four widgets. You are welcome to find new images or icons, change how the attributions are presented, or not include images at all. You can define a theme, choose typography and iconography, and implement other concepts like motion as you see fit.</p>
        <p>We recognize that this may be a short deadline to complete a full mockup, but we do ask that you complete your mockup by the assigned due date. The main objective of this assignment is learning to <em>implement</em> a design, and experience firsthand technical barriers which may arise when trying to do so. Do the best you can within the time constraints.</p>
        <p>To submit, upload your mockup file on <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557075">Canvas</a>.</p>
        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This part of the assignment is worth <strong>3 points</strong>, and is graded on completion. Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="checkin">Part 2: {{assignments[1].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[1].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>Now that you have a mockup, begin working to implementing it in HTML and CSS using Adobe Spectrum's <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/">Web Components</a>. We have taken care of importing the components for you, in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of each page. You can therefore ignore the guidance in the "usage" section of each the descriptions. The "example" blocks may be useful, as well as the "API" tab.</p>
        <p>Importantly, your implementation must support the intended functionality. E.g., Adobe Spectrum components may not function the way you expect or desire. The code provided to you in <code>script.js</code> may not function as expected. This will likely mean that you won't be able to implement your design as planned. You may also choose to add functionality as you get a better sense of how the components operate.</p>
        <p>Feel free to edit your design as you dive deeper into the components. Document the changes you had to make, and what you learned about the process, in your <code>readme.docx</code>. You will submit this file in the final part of the assignment.</p>
        <p>We do not have hard and fast requirements for what you complete by the code check-in. One recommendation would be to complete a draft of the order page, at least. Your code does not need to be fully functional at this stage, and will not yet be graded on its functionality. Treat this as a forcing function to complete some part of the assignment, and to check in with the course staff if you have having trouble with parts of it.</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your coderepository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557076">Canvas</a>. Include all files needed to run your webpage. You can remove the <code>default_html</code> folder and your mockup file (<code>mockup.fig</code> or <code>mockup.xd</code>), as these are not needed to run your webpage.</p>
        <p>This part of the the assignment is worth <strong>2 points</strong>, and is graded on completion. Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="final">Part 3: {{assignments[2].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[2].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>For this part, finish the implementation of your store. Add in all missing features, and polish your design.</p>
        <p>If you are coming into this class with a background in programming or development, you may want to consider extending your assignment to explore different aspects of Design Systems or add additional functionality to the website. One recommended extension is to re-implement the website in a different Design System, and compare how they operate. The course staff has demonstrated that the assignment is possible to complete with <a href="https://m3.material.io/develop/web">Google Material</a> (via <a href="https://www.mdui.org/en/">MDUI</a>, since Material <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/5642">stopped working on their Web Components</a>), <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fluent-ui/web-components/">Microsoft Fluent</a>, and <a href="https://carbondesignsystem.com/">IBM Carbon</a>. You can also add other functionality to the site which require coding. For example, you could add the ability to order individual widgets with custom colors (versus all widget of a particular type) and custom text engraving. We are open to other forms of extending the assignment for extra credit. Please contact the course staff if you have any ideas.</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your code repository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557077">Canvas</a>. Include all files needed to run your webpage, your design (either <code>mockup.fig</code> or <code>mockup.xd</code>) and the completed <code>readme.docx</code> file. You can remove the <code>default_html</code> folder, as this is not needed to run your webpage. Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <p>This part of the assignment is worth <strong>20 points</strong>, broken down as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interaction design of your mockup (2 points)</li>
            <li>Implementation of the order page (5 points)</li>
            <li>Implementation of the shipping page (5 points)</li>
            <li>Implementation of the summary page (5 points)</li>
            <li>Answers to questions in the readme (3 points)</li>
            <li>Any extensions to your assignment (up to 5 bonus points)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will deduct points on each page for intended functionality which is not supported. For example, expect a deduction if the colors of widgets cannot be customized, or if the summary page does not display the expected arrival date.</p>
