    <h1>A3: Accessibility Browser Extension</h1>
        <p>In this assignment, you are applying your newfound JavaScript skills to patching some accessibility issues present in webpages.</p>
        <p>You will create two extensions targeted at different websites, with a week and a half for each part. In <a href="assignments/a3#fakeuniversity">Part 1</a>, you will create an extension to fix a contrived example on a Fake University Website. In <a href="assignments/a3#wikipedia">Part 2</a>, you will apply these techniques to fix accessibility issues on Wikipedia.</p>
        <h2>Setting Up and Starter Code</h2>
        <p>Prior assignments offered flexibility in terms of what browser you used for development. Because we are specifically working on a browser extension, you must use <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. If you have significant experience with development, you may create your extension for another browser, but please clear it with the course staff first.</p>
        <p>The code is available for download <a href="https://github.com/uci-inf-285/a3-browser-extension">on GitHub</a>. Just like with A1 and A2, you can choose to create your own repository or download the code directly.</p>
        <h3>Repository Structure</h3>
        <p>The repository contains two folders, <code>fake_university_extension</code> (used in Part 1) and <code>wikipedia_extension</code> (used in Part 2). The two folders are roughly the same, with slight changes to the <code>manifest.json</code> and <code>icons</code> folder to distinguish the two extensions and indicate what website they should apply to. For each part, it's likely that you will only need to edit the <code>make_accessible.js</code> file. There is also a <code>readme.docx</code> to add some context about your submission and reflect on the process. Finally, the <code>helper_functions.js</code> file includes a few JavaScript functions which you might find useful for the assignment, like replacing a tag or wrapping one element with another.</p>
        <p>To get started, load the unpacked extension for the particular part from the <a href="chrome://extensions">extensions menu</a> in Chrome. After each time you edit your extension's code, make sure to refresh the extension in this menu as well as your webpage.</p>
        <p>Just like for A1 and A2, we recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to edit your files.</p>
        <h3>Getting Started with Silktide</h3>
        <p>In addition to downloading the code, you will need to install the <a href="https://silktide.com/toolbar/">Silktide Browser Extension</a>, which is designed to highlight accessibility issues. There are other extensions/tools for identifying issues, but for this assignment we'll rely on and compare against the Silktide report.</p>
        <p>Silktide contains a variety of features for testing out accessibility including a screen reader, highlighting focus order, and a color contrast checker. We will focus on the output of the "Accessibility checker" using the Automated test of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, which is roughly a summary of the others. Note that some of the features may not update as you edit your extension (e.g., the "Alt text" tab is not aware of text added via an extension). But the "Accessibility checker" has been tested, and will follow your extension's edits. You may also find it useful to use other accessibility tools like <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html">ANDI</a>, <a href="https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS">JAWS</a>, or <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac">VoiceOver</a> to check accessibility or navigate your page.</p>
        <p>As an automated tool, Silktide is often lacking the context necessary to assess whether a potential issue would actually undermine accessibility in practice. Since part of our goal in this assignment is to get practice modifying webpages via code, you will be asked to fix issues surfaced which may or may not be accessibility issues in practice. There will be opportunity to reflect on this distinction in your <code>readme.docx</code>.</p>
        <h3>DOM Manipulation Advice</h3>
        <p>This assignment will require digging into JavaScript documentation in order to identify and understand how to use different functions for DOM Manipulation. Much of the assignment can be implemented with functions you used in A2, such as <code>setAttribute</code> and <code>document.getElementBy*</code>. However, you will need to use other features to fix the accessibility issues. A few functions and properties which might prove useful include <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement">document.createElement</a></code>, <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute">hasAttribute</a></code>, <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild">appendChild</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style">style</a></code>.</p>
        <h2 id="fakeuniversity">Part 1: {{assignments[0].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[0].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>For the first part of the assignment, you will fix accessibility issues with <a href="https://fake-university.com/">fake-university.com</a>, a contrived example created by the Silktide developers to surface the kinds of errors that the tool can surface. You only need to address accessibility issues on the site's homepage.</p>
        <p>When first running Silktide, the extension surfaces 24 issues across 13 categories. The starter code for the extension (in the <code>fake_university_extension</code> folder) fixes the one issue in the "Skip to content" category. You will get your first point of credit just for running the extension!</p>
        <img width="400px" src="assignments/a3_fake_university.png">
        <p>To receive full credit on this part of the assignment, you must address 9 of the 13 categories, and can receive 0.5 points of extra credit for the other categories (up to 2 total). You must address all issues in a particular category to get full points for that category (e.g., addressing all of the links which lack a clear purpose). A few fixes will address multiple categories, such as adding alt text. Some categories are much easier to resolve than others; we suggest you start with alt text, page language and title, and link purpose.</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your code repository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557081">Canvas</a>. Note that there are some readme questions specific to this part that should be completed prior to submission.</p>
        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This part of the assignment is worth <strong>10 points</strong>, with 1 point for fixing each of 9 categories and the remaining point for completing your <code>readme.docx</code>. Up to 2 extra credit points can be earned for fixing issues in the remaining 4 categories. For partial credit, describe your progress in your <code>readme.docx</code> file. Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="wikipedia">Part 2: {{assignments[1].name}}</h2>
        <h3>Due {{assignments[1].dueStr}} PST</h3>
        <p>Now that you have a bit of practice using DOM Manipulation features to resolve accessibility issues, you will move to a real website. We have selected Wikipedia, and specifically Wikipedia's page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, as a site that is a bit more structured but still contains some accessibility issues. As an ever-changing page, it's possible that these issues could be fixed during the duration of the assignment. Maybe wait until after your assignment is due to suggest edits to the page!</p>
        <img width="400px" src="assignments/a3_wikipedia.png">
        <p>According to Silktide, Wikipedia's JavaScript page contains 28 issues across 12 categories. Because the codebase is more complex, so is fixing many of these issues. Further, Silktide's report as a higher rate of false positives, suggesting some issues which practically will not impact accessibility. You therefore only need to address 7 categories for full credit, and can receive 0.5 points of extra credit for the other categories (up to 2 total). We recommend starting with alt text, contrast, table heading scopes, duplicate IDs, and screen reader links.</p>
        <p>To submit, zip your code repository and upload it to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/71825/assignments/1557082">Canvas</a>. Make sure to fill out and include your <code>readme.docx</code>.</p>
        <p>This part of the the assignment is worth <strong>15 points</strong>, with 1.5 points for fixing each of 7 categories and the remaining 4.5 points for completing your <code>readme.docx</code>. For partial credit, describe your progress in your <code>readme.docx</code> file Any late uploads are subject to the course's <a href="/syllabus#duedates">late policy</a>.</p>
